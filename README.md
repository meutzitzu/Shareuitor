# Shareuitor

### Uhm, but what the fuck is a shareuitor ?

'tis but a simple program scris din coada sapii 

### Okay, but what does it do ?

Because I am a very untrustful individual who has a pathological obsession with _elementarism_ I often find myselfusing `python3 -m http.server 8080` in order to share files to someone. This is of course very convenient, but it has the slight downsize of having the pther person tell me that 1992 called and it said it wanted it's UX back.

### How does it work ?

It is very shitty. It uses `sed` in a shell script to generate an index.html file and style.css that makes the whole thing not look like absolute garbage.

### Wow, this is horrible ...

I know, right ? It doesn't even update dynamically when new files are added into the folder, lmfao

### Indeed ... but now the real question is ...

#### What the fuck are you doing here reading this ? I sincerely hope you don't plan on actually using this.

##### Now fuck off and do whatever it was you were supposed to do instead of wasting your time reading this shit
